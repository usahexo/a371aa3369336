#  Woman Claims She Won $825,000 At New York Empire Casino Shield Game

A woman who wishes to remain anonymous has come forward and claimed she won $825,000 playing a game of Shield at the New York Empire Casino.

The woman, in her early 50s, says that she was playing the game with a friend and decided to switch to the higher paying "Shield" game. She hit the jackpot on her very first spin.

"I just couldn't believe it," said the woman. "I've been going to that casino for years and never had anything even close to that big happen."

She says that she plans to use the money to pay off her debts and take a much-needed vacation.

Casino officials say that they are reviewing security footage to see if the win is legitimate.

#  Authorities Looking Into Empire Casino Shield Game Allegations

The New York authorities are investigating the Empire Casino for possible cheating of a game. The casino has been reported to have used a shield to help one of its players win a game.

The allegations surfaced after a video of the game was posted on social media. The video appears to show the player using a shield to block the ball from hitting other players’ cups. This gave the player an unfair advantage and helped them win the game.

The Empire Casino has denied any wrong doing and claims that the shield was simply used for protection. However, authorities are still investigating the matter and will determine if any laws were broken.

This is not the first time that the Empire Casino has been in the news. In fact, it has a history of legal troubles. In 2016, it was fined for violating anti-money laundering laws. And, in 2017, it was fined for illegally accepting bets from customers in New Jersey.

It is unclear what will happen to the casino if it is found guilty of cheating in this latest case. However, it is likely that it will face significant penalties, which could include a fine and/or a suspension or revocation of its license.

#  Slot Machines Malfunction At Empire Casino Shield Game 

Whilst playing the popular game, Empire Casino Shield, at the Empire Casino, a number of slot machines malfunctioned. This caused mass frustration amongst players who were left out of pocket and unable to continue with the game.

The malfunction occurred on Saturday 8th December just after 5pm and lasted for approximately 45 minutes. During this time, players were unable to win any prizes or cash-outs from the games. In addition, a number of machines stopped working completely, which resulted in long queues as people waited to use alternative machines.

Casino bosses have said that they are “very sorry” for the inconvenience caused and have promised to do everything possible to make up for the issues. They have already offered affected players free spins and bonus money as an apology.

A spokesperson for the casino said: “We can confirm that some slot machines went wrong on Saturday evening at our Empire Casino Shield game. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused and would like to assure our customers that we are doing everything possible to make things right. We have already offered affected players free spins and bonus money as an apology and we hope that they will enjoy these bonuses and continue to choose our casino for their gaming needs.”
