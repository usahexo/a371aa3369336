#  Why did the Arizona Cardinals choose Kofi A. Annan?

The Cardinals were looking for someone who could lead the team on and off the field. They found that in Kofi Annan. Annan is a powerful speaker and motivator who has a great sense of humor. He is also an excellent player.

Annan was born in Ghana and moved to the United States when he was young. He played football in high school and college. After college, he played for several teams in the NFL.

In 2009, Annan was chosen as the starting quarterback for the Cardinals. He led the team to several victories that season. He was also chosen as the MVP of the Super Bowl.

Annan has been a very positive force in the Arizona community. He has worked with several charities and donated his time to many causes. He is also a role model for young people.

The Cardinals are very lucky to have Annan on their team. He is a talented player and an outstanding leader.

#  What do Annan's colleagues think of him?

Former United States president Bill Clinton has hailed outgoing United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan as an extraordinary global servant.

In a statement from his office, Mr Clinton said: "He proved that a weak and poor country can lead the United Nations and make a big difference in the lives of people around the world."

"Kofi Annan was one of the greats of our time - a passionate advocate for human rights, peace, and security," he added.

US president George Bush also praised Mr Annan, calling him "a good and decent man who has served his country well".

British prime minister Tony Blair said he was "deeply sorry" to hear of Mr Annan's resignation, adding: "He has been a towering figure at the UN and in international affairs for many years."

Mr Blair described Mr Annan as someone who had always put the global interest first.

#  How did Annan become involved with the United Nations?

Kofi Annan was born in Kumasi, Ghana on April 8, 1938. He attended the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, where he earned a degree in engineering. After working for several years as an engineer, Annan joined the United Nations in 1965. He worked his way up the ranks, eventually becoming the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Annan's involvement with the United Nations began in 1965, when he started working for the organization as an economist. He worked his way up through the ranks, eventually becoming the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations. During his time as Secretary-General, Annan was heavily involved in trying to resolve some of the world's most pressing issues, including the conflict in Iraq and the global AIDS epidemic.

Annan resigned as Secretary-General in 2006, after allegations that he had mishandled a corruption scandal involving the UN's oil-for-food program in Iraq. However, he remained involved with the United Nations thereafter, serving as a Special Envoy for Global Education. In 2012, Annan was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the United Nations.

#  What does Annan think of the role of the UN in the world today?

In a speech to the UN General Assembly in 2018, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s successor, António Guterres, said that the organization was at a “critical moment.” This sentiment has been echoed by others, including former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. There is no doubt that the UN is essential to global stability and peace, but it is also clear that the body faces significant challenges in fulfilling its mandate.



What are some of these challenges? One issue is the UN’s inability to prevent or halt conflicts. In his farewell speech to the General Assembly in 2006, Kofi Annan said: “The United Nations was born from the ashes of war, and its first task was to keep the peace. We have done better in some places than others, but we have not always succeeded. Too often, we have been slow to act – or ineffective. Sometimes, we have been wrong.” For example, the UN has not been able to stop ongoing civil wars in Syria and Yemen. In addition, according to Amnesty International, over 3 million people were killed as a result of armed conflict between 1991 and 2016 – and this number does not include civilian casualties from airstrikes conducted by member states of the US-led coalition against ISIS.



A second challenge for the UN is its growing financial crisis. The organization’s regular budget has increased from $2.5 billion in 2000 to $5.4 billion today, but its income has not kept pace. As a result, member states are increasingly behind in their payments to the organization; as of June 2018, the total arrears amounted to $2.3 billion. This significantly hampers the UN’s ability to fulfill its mission.



A third challenge facing the UN is its lack of representation and accountability. The current structure of the Security Council gives disproportionate power to five countries: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This has led to criticism that decisions made by this body are not representative of all 193 member states of the UN General Assembly. In addition, since 1945 only two women (Dame Margaret Anstee and Boutros Boutros-Ghali) have served as secretary-general – despite there being more than half a billion women in the world today. This lack of diversity undermines both representation and accountability at the highest levels of decision-making within the UN system.



Despite these challenges, there is no doubt that the UN remains an essential institution for global stability and peace. What is needed now is a concerted effort by Member States to address these shortcomings and ensure that the body can continue fulfilling its mandate into the future
