#  Washington Commanders betting odds released by online sportsbook!

Just a few weeks ago the Washington Commanders announced their coaching staff and roster. Now, we are one step closer to the season kicking off as the odds for their season opener have been released.

The Commanders will open their season on the road against the Atlanta Legends. The Legends currently sit as two-point favorites in this matchup with the Commanders receiving +2 points.

Some of the other opening odds matchups include:

The Houston Stallions are favored by 6.5 points over the Dallas Renegades while the San Antonio Commanders are favored by 3.5 points over the LA Wildcats. Interestingly, in both of those games the underdog is getting more points than Washington is in their matchup against Atlanta.

There is no doubt that there is a lot of excitement surrounding Washington this year and it will be interesting to see how they fare against some of the other teams in the league.

#  Washington Commanders open as 5-point favorites against Atlanta Legends

The Washington Commanders opened as 5-point favorites against the Atlanta Legends in the inaugural season of the Alliance of American Football on Sunday.

This matchup pits the Legends, who are coming off a 2-14 season in 2018, against the Commanders, who finished last season 9-7 and won their division in the Northeast Conference.

Atlanta will be quarterbacked by Matt Simms, while Washington will start Cardale Jones.

The Legends have made some offseason moves to improve their team, including signing wide receivers Jalen Tolliver and Devin Smith. However, they will be facing a tough challenge against a Washington team that returns many of its key players from last year.

The Commanders’ offense is led by running back Ty Isaac and wide receivers Kenny Lawler and Kayaune Ross. The defense is anchored by defensive tackle Darius Kilgo and linebacker Jon Bostic.

Washington is looking to become the first team to win a championship in the new league.

#  Third NFL team sees action in Week 1, with betting odds leaning towards the Commanders

The XFL is gearing up for its second season, and the betting odds are in for who will take home the championship. In their first week of games, Dallas takes on Seattle while Houston faces Los Angeles. 

Las Vegas seems to believe that the Dallas Cowboys will be the team to beat this year. They have set the Cowboys’ odds at 6-1, while the LA Rams are right behind them at 7-1. The Seahawks and Texans both come in with 10-1 odds, making them strong contenders as well. 

Interestingly, the Commanders are not far behind, despite being a newly formed team. They come in with 12-1 odds, just ahead of the Tampa Bay Vipers (15-1) and New York Guardians (20-1). 

The NFL isn’t the only one with teams preparing for their upcoming season. The XFL has announced that they have added a third team: the Seattle Dragons. This makes for a total of eight teams in the league, each competing for the chance to become XFL champions. 

And with opening weekend quickly approaching, it’s time to start placing your bets!

#  Odds for Washington Commanders matchup released, is this the week they cover?

The Washington Commanders are coming into their matchup against the Seattle Dragons this week as 3.5 point favorites. The Commanders had a great inaugural game, beating the Houston Roughnecks 58-14. The Seattle Dragons, on the other hand, lost to the Los Angeles Wildcats 22-17 in their first game.

So far this season, there have been six games where one team was favored by 3.5 points or more and the underdog covered the spread. This would give the Dragons a 38% chance of covering the spread in this game. However, when looking at just home teams in these situations, they have covered the spread only 27% of the time, which gives the Commanders a 73% chance of covering the spread.

When looking at the total points scored in these six games, there has been an average of 50 points scored per game. With both teams being high-powered offenses, it is likely that this game will also have a high score and go over the projected total of 50 points.

The Washington Commanders are a new team in the Alliance of American Football (AAF) and they are already one of the most talked about teams in the league. The Commanders have some big-name players on their roster, including quarterback Cardale Jones and wide receiver DeSean Jackson.

The Commanders will be playing their first game of the season this weekend and the betting line is already very close. The current odds have the Commanders as a 2.5 point favorite against the San Antonio Commanders.

There are some good reasons to bet on the Washington Commanders this weekend. First, they have a very strong offense led by Cardale Jones. Jones is a former Ohio State Buckeye who won a national championship with the team in 2014. He has also played in the NFL for the Buffalo Bills and Los Angeles Chargers.

Second, the Washington defense is also very strong. They have two top defensive players in linebacker Ahmad Brooks and cornerback Captain Munnerlyn. Brooks was a three-time All-Pro selection in the NFL, while Munnerlyn was a First-Team All-Pro selection in 2013.

Finally, the San Antonio Commanders are not a very strong team. They only won three games last season in the now-defunct XFL and do not have any high-profile players on their roster.

All things considered, it looks like wise decision to bet on the Washington Commanders this weekend. They are a strong team with plenty of talent and should be able to take out San Antonio easily.
