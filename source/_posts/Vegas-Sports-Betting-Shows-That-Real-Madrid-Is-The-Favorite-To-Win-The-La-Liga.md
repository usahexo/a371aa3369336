#  Vegas Sports Betting Shows That Real Madrid Is The Favorite To Win The La Liga

The results of the latest Vega sports betting lines show that Spanish giant Real Madrid is the favorite to win the La Liga this season. The line for Madrid winning the league is set at -175, meaning that for every $175 bet, you would win $100 in return. This puts them as clear favorites over second-placed Barcelona, who have a line of +325 (meaning you would earn $325 for every $100 bet).

There is good reason for these odds, as Madrid have been by far and away the best team in Spain in recent years. They have won the La Liga twice in the last three seasons, and look poised to make it a three-peat this year. Their attack has been devastating, with stars like Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, and Karim Benzema leading the charge. They are also strong defensively, led by captain Sergio Ramos and goalkeeper Keylor Navas.

 Barcelona have been a very close second to Madrid in recent years, but they will need to step up their game if they want to usurp their rivals this season. Led by talisman Lionel Messi, they possess plenty of attacking firepower themselves. However, they often struggle defensively and could be punished by Madrid’s potent strike force.

Third-placed Atletico Madrid are also worth keeping an eye on this season. They have been one of the most consistent teams in Europe over the past few years, reaching two Champions League finals in four seasons. However, they have struggled to keep up with Barcelona and Real Madrid domestically, and are currently some way off the pace in La Liga.

So far this season, Real Madrid have looked unstoppable and look poised to win their third consecutive La Liga title. Barcelona will be hoping to put up more of a fight than they did last year, but it looks like Madrid are still head and shoulders above everyone else in Spain.

#  Vegas Sportsbooks Are Favoring Real Madrid To Win The Champions League

Las Vegas sportsbooks have made reigning champion Real Madrid their favorites to win this year’s Champions League.

Real are coming off a disappointing season by their standards, having finished third in La Liga and failing to make real progress in the Champions League. Los Blancos have been somewhat erratic this season and they will be looking to redeem themselves in Europe when they take on Paris Saint Germain in the round of 16 next month.

Most bookmakers have Real Madrid as favorites to lift the trophy at the end of the competition, with some offering odds as short as 2/1. PSG are 5/1 shots to go all the way, while Barcelona are available at 7/2. Premier League champions Manchester City are rank outsiders at 12/1.

The Champions League is always a difficult tournament to call, with so many teams capable of going all the way, but Real Madrid will be confident of success this year. They have some of the best players in the world and, if they can get their act together, they should be able to beat anyone on their day.

#  Bettors Backing Madrid With Their Money In Las Vegas Ahead Of UCL Showdown

It's no secret that when it comes to European football (soccer for our American friends), Real Madrid is one of the juggernauts. They've been crowned Champions League winners a record 12 times and are always among the favorites to make a deep run in the tournament.

This year looks to be no different, as they made it all the way to the semifinals where they'll take on Liverpool. The first leg will be played at Anfield Stadium in Liverpool on May 3, with the return leg scheduled for a week later at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.

Real Madrid is currently a 1/2 favorite to win the tie, while Liverpool is priced at 7/2 according to sportsbook William Hill. Bettors seem to think that there's not much separating these two teams, as around 57% of all money wagered is backing Los Blancos.

If you're looking for some value, you might want to consider betting on Liverpool to pull off the upset. They're coming into this matchup in good form, having won their last five matches in all competitions. Additionally, their front three of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, and Roberto Firmino have been terrorizing opponents all season long.

Based on these factors, it wouldn't be a huge surprise to see Liverpool come away with a win or draw in the first leg. In fact, if you put your money on them at odds of 10/3, you would only need them to pull off one of these outcomes to make a profit.

#  Las Vegas sportsbooks have Madrid as heavy favorites to win the Spanish league

# bookmakers in the Nevada city have installed the La Liga champions as -450

# outsiders Barcelona are at +500, while Atletico Madrid are at +1200

Las Vegas sportsbooks have installed defending La Liga champions Real Madrid as heavy favorites to win the Spanish league division again. The bookmakers in the Nevada city have installed Los Blancos as -450 favorites, while outsiders Barcelona are at +500, while Atletico Madrid are at +1200. This is despite Madrid losing their all-time top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus in the offseason. The 33-year-old Portugal international left the Spanish capital after nine seasons, during which time he won four Champions League titles and two Ballon D’Ors.

#  Soccer betting odds: Real Madrid strong favorite to win in Spain, England

With much of the focus on the upcoming World Cup, it's easy to forget about club soccer. However, the European Champions League is heating up and there are some tantalizing matchups this week.

One of the most anticipated contests is at the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, where Real Madrid will take on Juventus. The Spanish powerhouse is a strong favorite to win, as they are currently listed at -245 on soccer betting odds, while Juve comes in at +710.

It's interesting to note that Juventus' odds have actually improved since Cristiano Ronaldo left for Los Blancos. The Portuguese superstar was a huge part of Juve's success in recent years and many thought that they would struggle without him. However, new signing Gonzalo Higuain has been performing well and has led his team to the top of Serie A.

Juventus should still be considered a strong side, but they are likely going to find it difficult to beat Madrid in their own back yard. Ronaldo will be looking to add to his tally of 15 goals against his former club, while Higuain will be trying to prove he is worthy of his big-money move.

In England, another marquee matchup takes place as Tottenham Hotspur host Barcelona at Wembley Stadium. Spurs come into this one as underdogs at +425 while Barcelona are listed at -165.

This could be an extremely exciting match, as both teams like to play an attractive style of soccer which should result in plenty of goals. Tottenham have been in great form this season and will be hoping to upset La Liga's leaders.

Barcelona have Lionel Messi leading the attack, and he always poses a threat no matter who he is playing against. If Spurs can keep him quiet then they definitely have a chance of winning, but it won't be easy.

There are other matches taking place this week including Liverpool vs Porto and Bayern Munich vs Besiktas, so be sure to check out the latest soccer betting odds before making any bets.
