#  Russian Federation Now Home to More Than 3,000 Slot Machines! 

In Russia, the slot machine industry is booming. The Russian Federation now has more than 3,000 slot machines, and this number is growing rapidly.

Why are Russians so drawn to slot machines? There are a few reasons. First, slot machines are a relatively easy way to gamble and make money. Second, many Russians see gambling as a fun way to pass the time. And third, casinos in Russia are often not well-regulated, meaning that players can take advantage of lax rules and high payout rates.

The Russian government is aware of the growing popularity of slot machines and is starting to take steps to regulate the industry. In particular, the government is working on a new law that will restrict the number of slots that can be installed in any given casino. This law is expected to come into effect in 2019.

In the meantime, the Russian slot machine industry continues to grow at a rapid pace.

#  Russian Federation Now Has More Slot Machines Than Las Vegas!

In March of 2018 it was reported that the Russian Federation had more slot machines than Las Vegas. With over 200,000 slot machines in Russia, and only 165,000 in Las Vegas, this is a significant change.

There are many reasons for this change. For one, the Russian government has been encouraging investment in the gambling industry. And while gambling was once illegal in Russia, it has been legalized since 2009. In addition, there are now many more casinos in Russia than there are in Las Vegas.

This shift is also indicative of broader changes in the Russian economy. After years of recession following the global financial crisis, the Russian economy is starting to revive. This is especially true in the gambling sector, where revenue has grown by 20% per year over the past three years.

But not everyone is happy about this development. Some people argue that the proliferation of slot machines is leading to increased levels of addiction and social problems. Others worry that it is encouraging criminal activity, as criminals convert legitimate income into gambling money.

Whatever one’s opinion on the matter, it is clear that Russia’s slot machine industry is booming.
