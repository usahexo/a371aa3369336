#  Nevada Leads The Way In Gambling Legalization

This week, the Nevada state Assembly voted to approve a bill that would legalize most forms of gambling in the state. This follows on the heels of a similar measure passing in the state Senate last month. If Governor Brian Sandoval signs the bill into law, it would make Nevada the first state to officially legalize most forms of gambling.

The proposed bill would legalize online poker, online casino games, and daily fantasy sports. It would also allow casinos to offer betting on sports events, subject to approval from the state gaming commission. In addition, the bill would allow for mobile gambling devices such as phones and tablets.

The move is seen as a way for Nevada to recapture some of its lost gambling revenue. With legalized gambling now available in many other states, Nevada has fallen behind in terms of revenue from gambling activities. The new bill is expected to bring in an additional $250 million per year in revenue for the state.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to more social problems such as addiction and crime. Supporters argue that legalization will help to regulate and control gambling activity, and that it will provide much-needed revenue for the state budget.

It remains to be seen whether Governor Sandoval will sign the bill into law, but if he does, Nevada could become a leading example for other states looking to legalize gambling.

#  Atlantic City Staying Relevant With Legal Gambling

Atlantic City, NJ has been fighting hard to stay relevant in the past few years. Once a premier tourist destination, the city has been losing out to other gambling destinations like Las Vegas and Atlantic City is looking to legalize online gambling to bring people back.

The city’s Casino Association has hired former Pennsylvania state Sen. Vince Fumo as a lobbyist to push for the legalization of online gambling. The hope is that this will help keep Atlantic City competitive with other destinations and bring in new revenue streams.

Atlantic City is not the only city lobbying for legalized online gambling. Numerous other states are looking to do the same, including Illinois, New York, and California. These states see legalizing online gambling as a way to help boost their economies and bring in new revenue streams.

The debate over legalizing online gambling has been raging for years now, with proponents saying it will help revive struggling casino towns and opponents arguing that it will lead to more addiction and social ills. So far, no state has fully legalized online gambling, but many are moving closer towards doing so.

It remains to be seen whether or not Atlantic City will be successful in its push for legalized online gambling, but it is clear that the city is looking for any way possible to stay afloat.

#  States All Over America Embrace Gambling Laws

Gambling has been a topic of debate for many years. The moral and social implications of gambling have been discussed at length. However, in recent years, gambling has become legal in more states.

States all over America are embracing gambling laws. For example, New Jersey recently passed a bill that allows people to gamble online. This move is expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the state.

In addition, several other states are considering legalizing online gambling. These include Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Illinois.

There are several reasons for this trend. First, gambling can be a significant source of revenue for states. In addition, it can create jobs and promote tourism. Finally, it is an effective way to raise money for various causes, such as education or infrastructure projects.

Opponents of gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and social problems. However, proponents argue that these risks can be managed with appropriate regulation.

Ultimately, the decision about whether to legalize gambling lies with the individual states. However, the trend towards legalization is clear and is likely to continue in the years ahead

#  Illinois Casinos Finally Open After Years Of Debate 

After years of debate, Illinois lawmakers have finally come to an agreement on how to regulate and tax casinos in the state. This comes after Illinois has been without any form of commercial gambling since 2009, when then-Governor Rod Blagojevich shut down all gambling establishments in the state.

Now that casinos are set to reopen, there is much speculation over which ones will fare the best. The city of Chicago is likely to see the most success, as it is already a popular tourist destination. There are also a number of smaller towns around the state that are hoping to benefit from casino tourism.

One question that remains unanswered is what kind of impact the casinos will have on neighboring states. Iowa and Missouri both have large casino industries, and it is unclear how Illinois’s new casinos will affect their business. Some experts believe that there may be a bit of cannibalization, with people traveling to Illinois casinos rather than those in neighboring states. However, it is also possible that people will simply travel across state lines to take advantage of different offerings.

Regardless of the long-term effects, Illinois’s casino industry is off to a strong start. The first few weeks since the legalization have seen record-breaking revenue numbers, and it looks like things are only going to get better from here.

#  More And More States Legalizing Gambling To Boost Economy

The gambling industry is booming in the United States, with more and more states legalizing some form of gambling in an effort to boost their economies.

According to the American Gaming Association, gambling revenues reached a record high of $261 billion in 2017, and they are expected to reach $278 billion by 2020. This growth is being driven by the legalization of new types of gambling, such as online poker and esports betting.

One state that has seen a significant increase in gambling revenue is Pennsylvania. In 2017, Pennsylvania collected over $1.4 billion in taxes from its legalized gambling industry, up from just $657 million in 2012. This increase has been largely driven by the legalization of online poker and casino games in 2016.

Other states that have seen a significant increase in gambling revenue include New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada. These states have all legalized online poker, casino games, and sports betting.

While the growth of the gambling industry is good news for lawmakers and business owners, it can be bad news for problem gamblers and their families. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, 2-3% of Americans are pathological gamblers, and another 5-8% are at risk for developing a problem.
