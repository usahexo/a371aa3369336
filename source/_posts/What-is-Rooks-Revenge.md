#  What is Rooks Revenge?

Rooks Revenge is a computer game that is played on a chessboard. The game can be played by two players or by one player against the computer. The aim of the game is to capture the opponent's king.

The game begins with each player having sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops and eight pawns. Black starts the game. The chessboard is placed so that a white square is in the lower right hand corner.

To win the game, black must move its king to the square in the lower left hand corner or capture the white king. If white moves its king to the square in the upper left hand corner, black can either capture the white king or place its king on the square in the lower right hand corner, thereby winning the game.

#  Who developed Rooks Revenge?

Rooks Revenge was initially designed as an undergraduate project at the University of York, England by Matt Groves and James A.F. Brown in early 2014.

The game was designed primarily for the Android mobile platform, with cross-platform compatibility being a core design requirement. The game has been in development since early 2014, and is currently available on the Google Play Store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mgralrus.rooksrevenge&hl=en).

A subsequent university project saw further development by Rich Latham and Christian Dangremond (https://github.com/RichLatham/RooksRevenge), who ported the game to iOS and created a multiplayer mode.

Since its inception, Rooks Revenge has been primarily developed by students and hobbyists, with occasional contributions from professional developers.

#  What inspired the creators of Rooks Revenge?

Rooks Revenge was created as an answer to the popular tile-based puzzle game, 2048. The creator’s main goal was to create a game that was more challenging and strategic than 2048.

# How do you play Rooks Revenge?

The game board is an 8x8 grid, and the objective is to merge tiles to create a tile with the value of 2048. However, in Rooks Revenge, you can only merge tiles if they are adjacent to each other. In addition, any merged tiles will be removed from the board, so you have to be strategic about where you merge your tiles.

# What are the different tile values?

The different tile values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64. When you merge two tiles whose value equals 1024 (for example, two 8s), the resulting tile will have a value of 2048.

# How do I win Rooks Revenge?

To win Rooks Revenge, you have to reach a value of 2048 on the board. Once you reach this value, the game is over and you have won!

#  How do you play Rooks Revenge?

Rooks Revenge is a two-player strategy board game where each player attempts to capture the other player’s king. The game is played on a square board with eight columns and eight rows. Each player has sixteen pieces: one king, one rook, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The game can be played with either black or white pieces.

The game begins with the players both having their king in the center of the board and all other pieces on the first rank. Black moves first. On a turn, a player either moves one of their pieces, captures an opponent’s piece with one of their pieces, or promotes one of their pawns to a piece of their choice (except for a king). Pieces can only move orthogonally, except for rooks which can move any number of squares along a rank or file as long as it does not jump over another piece. A pawn can only move forward one square at a time, but it can move two squares if it is first promoted to a piece other than a king.

The object of the game is to capture the opponent’s king. If a player’s king is captured, they lose the game.
