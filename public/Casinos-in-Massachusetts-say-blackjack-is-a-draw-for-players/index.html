<p>Blackjack, the most popular casino game in the United States, is seeing a resurgence in popularity in Massachusetts. According to the state’s casinos, blackjack is a big draw among players.</p>
<p>“It seems as if players are really drawn to blackjack and its classic gaming appeal,” said Debra Seder, spokeswoman for MGM Springfield. “The mix of skill and chance makes it an attractive option for people looking for a fun and exciting gaming experience.”</p>
<p>Casinos are reporting increased visitation numbers thanks in part to the addition of blackjack tables. In Springfield, MGM has seen visitation numbers grow by 7 percent since it began offering blackjack last year. At Plainridge Park Casino, 9-table blackjack debuted last month and resulted in a 14-percent increase in visitation from September 2017 to September 2018.</p>
<p>“The table games have been doing really well,” said Paul McAndrew, director of marketing at Plainridge Park Casino. “We’re excited about that.”</p>
<p>Blackjack is currently offered at 10 of Massachusetts’ 11 casinos. The only casino without blackjack is Twin River Casino in Lincoln, which does not offer table games. The addition of blackjack has also led to an increase in revenue for the casinos; at MGM Springfield, table game revenue has grown by 83 percent since the casino opened last year.</p>
<p>Though some may see gambling as a vice, it can be argued that casinos provide a valuable service by creating jobs and generating tax revenue. In Massachusetts, casinos have created 8,000 jobs and generated more than $260 million in tax revenue since they opened their doors.</p>
<h1 id="Is-blackjack-your-game-Massachusetts-casinos-want-you-to-know-they-offer-the-best-options-around"><a href="#Is-blackjack-your-game-Massachusetts-casinos-want-you-to-know-they-offer-the-best-options-around" class="headerlink" title="Is blackjack your game? Massachusetts casinos want you to know they offer the best options around"></a>Is blackjack your game? Massachusetts casinos want you to know they offer the best options around</h1><p>Casinos in Massachusetts are upping their game by appealing to blackjack aficionados. On the table, that means plenty of new games and variations – including some exclusive to the Bay State – making it easier than ever for players to find their perfect game.</p>
<p>“There’s something for everyone at our casinos, but blackjack is always a fan favorite,” said Edward Palleschi, general manager of Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville. “We’re always looking for ways to improve the player experience, and with so many variations of the game now available, we know there’s a perfect game out there for everyone.”</p>
<p>At Plainridge Park Casino, that includes games like Spanish 21 and Match Play 21, both of which offer unique twists on the classic game. Other popular options include Double Deck Blackjack, which features smaller decks for a more fast-paced game; and Atlantic City Blackjack, which comes with a side bet that could see players winning huge payouts.</p>
<p>For those looking for an even more exotic gaming experience, MGM Springfield is home to one of only two Brazilian Pontoon tables in North America. This variation of blackjack offers players an opportunity to win big payouts on side bets, while still enjoying all the excitement of the classic game.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, MGM Springfield also offers an innovative “Shuffle Master Showdown” game which pits players against each other in a head-to-head battle to see who can get closest to 21 without going bust. With five different games available on this single table, there’s something for everyone!</p>
<p>Players looking for blackjack variations outside of Massachusetts need look no further than Foxwoods Resort Casino. There you can find games such as Ultimate Texas Hold ‘Em and Three Card Poker – both of which offer unique betting opportunities not found in traditional blackjack games. Or if you’re looking for a more classic experience, try out Double Exposure Blackjack which gives players a chance to see both dealer cards before making their decision.</p>
<p>No matter what your preference, Massachusetts casinos have you covered. So come on in and enjoy all the best that blackjack has to offer!</p>
<h1 id="Enjoy-blackjack-like-a-pro-at-any-of-Massachusetts’-gambling-destinations"><a href="#Enjoy-blackjack-like-a-pro-at-any-of-Massachusetts’-gambling-destinations" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy blackjack like a pro at any of Massachusetts’ gambling destinations"></a>Enjoy blackjack like a pro at any of Massachusetts’ gambling destinations</h1><p>For those who are looking to enjoy some blackjack action, Massachusetts has a number of great gambling destinations to choose from. You can find a casino or racetrack with all the bells and whistles, or head to one of the smaller venues for a more intimate experience. No matter what your preference, we’ve got you covered with our guide to the best blackjack spots in the Bay State.</p>
<p>The biggest and most popular destination for blackjack players is Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville. This casino has everything you could want, including over 1,000 slot machines and gaming tables. There’s also a variety of restaurants and bars on site, so you can enjoy a full evening out. Blackjack is available in both regular and VIP variants, so there’s something for everyone at Plainridge Park Casino.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a smaller casino with more personalized service, then you’ll want to check out MGM Springfield. This venue opened its doors in 2018 and has quickly become a favorite among blackjack players. The casino offers classic blackjack games as well as several variations, including Spanish 21 and Double Exposure Blackjack. There’s also a high limit room for those looking to play for big bucks.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling lucky, then head over to Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket. This massive complex offers something for everyone, including six casinos, four hotels, and world-class dining and entertainment options. And of course, there’s plenty of blackjack action to be had at any of Foxwoods’ gaming tables. You can find everything from traditional blackjack games to more exotic variants like Pai Gow and Super Fun 21.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re looking for a Racino experience rather than a full-blown casino, then head over to Plainville Downs or Raynham Park Racetrack. Both of these venues offer live harness racing along with electronic gaming machines, giving you plenty of options when it comes to placing your bets. And if blackjack is your game of choice, both venues have ample tables where you can try your luck against the dealer.</p>
<h1 id="From-Springfield-to-Boston-find-the-perfect-casino-for-playing-blackjack-in-Massachusetts"><a href="#From-Springfield-to-Boston-find-the-perfect-casino-for-playing-blackjack-in-Massachusetts" class="headerlink" title="From Springfield to Boston, find the perfect casino for playing blackjack in Massachusetts"></a>From Springfield to Boston, find the perfect casino for playing blackjack in Massachusetts</h1><p>There are many great casinos in Massachusetts, but if you’re looking for the best place to play blackjack, Springfield is the place to be. The MGM Springfield offers blackjack tables with limits starting at $5 and going up to $1,000, as well as a luxurious setting with all the amenities you could want. If you’re looking for something a bit more low-key, the Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville also has blackjack tables with limits starting at just $2.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-play-and-win-blackjack-in-the-Bay-State’s-casinos"><a href="#How-to-play-and-win-blackjack-in-the-Bay-State’s-casinos" class="headerlink" title="How to play and win blackjack in the Bay State’s casinos"></a>How to play and win blackjack in the Bay State’s casinos</h1><p>There are a few things you need to know when playing blackjack in Massachusetts casinos. The first is that the games are not all the same. There are multiple versions of the game, and the rules vary from casino to casino.</p>
<p>The basic rules of blackjack are to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer’s hand. The value of cards 2-10 are face value, while King, Queen and Jack are each worth 10 points. An Ace can be either 1 or 11 points, depending on what suits your hand best.</p>
<p>Players can either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they have). If they go over 21, they bust and lose automatically. In some casinos, players can double down (double their bet and take one more card) after seeing their first two cards. They can also split pairs (split two like cards into two separate hands), but in most casinos you can only do this once.</p>
<p>If the dealer has an Ace showing, they will offer insurance to players. This is a side bet that pays 2:1 if the player loses to the dealer (ie their hand is 22 or higher). Insurance costs half of your original bet.</p>
<p>There are a few other variations on these rules - for example, some casinos allow players to re-split pairs (split again if they have two identical cards), or surrender (give up half their bet if they think they’re going to lose). As always, it’s best to ask at the casino what the specific rules are before playing.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to know is that blackjack pays out different amounts depending on where you play. In most Bay State casinos, blackjack pays 3:2 - for every $5 you wager, you’ll get back $7.50 including your original bet. However, there are some casinos which offer 6:5 payouts - for every $5 wagered you’ll only get back $6 including your original bet. It’s important to know which payout system your chosen casino uses before playing!</p>
<p>Finally, remember that while blackjack is a relatively easy game to learn, it takes practice to become good at it! Don’t be discouraged if you don’t win every hand in your first few games - just keep practicing and learning optimal strategies and eventually you’ll start raking in the wins.</p>
