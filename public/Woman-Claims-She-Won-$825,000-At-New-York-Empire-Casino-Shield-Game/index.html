<p>The woman, in her early 50s, says that she was playing the game with a friend and decided to switch to the higher paying “Shield” game. She hit the jackpot on her very first spin.</p>
<p>“I just couldn’t believe it,” said the woman. “I’ve been going to that casino for years and never had anything even close to that big happen.”</p>
<p>She says that she plans to use the money to pay off her debts and take a much-needed vacation.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that they are reviewing security footage to see if the win is legitimate.</p>
<h1 id="Authorities-Looking-Into-Empire-Casino-Shield-Game-Allegations"><a href="#Authorities-Looking-Into-Empire-Casino-Shield-Game-Allegations" class="headerlink" title="Authorities Looking Into Empire Casino Shield Game Allegations"></a>Authorities Looking Into Empire Casino Shield Game Allegations</h1><p>The New York authorities are investigating the Empire Casino for possible cheating of a game. The casino has been reported to have used a shield to help one of its players win a game.</p>
<p>The allegations surfaced after a video of the game was posted on social media. The video appears to show the player using a shield to block the ball from hitting other players’ cups. This gave the player an unfair advantage and helped them win the game.</p>
<p>The Empire Casino has denied any wrong doing and claims that the shield was simply used for protection. However, authorities are still investigating the matter and will determine if any laws were broken.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Empire Casino has been in the news. In fact, it has a history of legal troubles. In 2016, it was fined for violating anti-money laundering laws. And, in 2017, it was fined for illegally accepting bets from customers in New Jersey.</p>
<p>It is unclear what will happen to the casino if it is found guilty of cheating in this latest case. However, it is likely that it will face significant penalties, which could include a fine and&#x2F;or a suspension or revocation of its license.</p>

This caused mass frustration amongst players who were left out of pocket and unable to continue with the game.</p>
<p>The malfunction occurred on Saturday 8th December just after 5pm and lasted for approximately 45 minutes. During this time, players were unable to win any prizes or cash-outs from the games. In addition, a number of machines stopped working completely, which resulted in long queues as people waited to use alternative machines.</p>
<p>Casino bosses have said that they are “very sorry” for the inconvenience caused and have promised to do everything possible to make up for the issues. They have already offered affected players free spins and bonus money as an apology.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the casino said: “We can confirm that some slot machines went wrong on Saturday evening at our Empire Casino Shield game. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused and would like to assure our customers that we are doing everything possible to make things right. We have already offered affected players free spins and bonus money as an apology and we hope that they will enjoy these bonuses and continue to choose our casino for their gaming needs.”</p>

<p>The $50 buy-in event, which had a total prize pool of $1,050, saw 11 players take part, with some notable faces in the mix.</p>
<p>The final table saw three Empire regulars – Andras Nemeth, Attila Szabo and Marton Cziraki – joined by first-time players Istvan Urban, Laszlo Szucs, Tibor Meszaros and Zoltan Szabo.</p>
<p>It was Szucs who came out on top after a tough battle against Nemeth heads up. Szucs took home the lion’s share of the prize pool after winning the title and $575 in prize money. Nemeth banked $405 for his second-place finish.</p>
<h1 id="Wins-Could-Reach-2-Million-In-Empire-Casino-Shield-Game"><a href="#Wins-Could-Reach-2-Million-In-Empire-Casino-Shield-Game" class="headerlink" title="Wins Could Reach $2 Million In Empire Casino Shield Game"></a>Wins Could Reach $2 Million In Empire Casino Shield Game</h1><p>On April 26, the Empire Casino in Leicester will host a shield game that is expected to bring in over $2 million in winnings. The event will be a three-day affair, and 20 teams are scheduled to compete. Leicester City Councilor Neil Putnam is expecting a large turnout for the event, which is being touted as the largest of its kind in Europe.</p>
<p>The star attraction of the event is likely to be British welterweight champion Kell Brook, who will be defending his title against U.S. fighter Shawn Porter. The fight is considered a 50-50 matchup by most pundits, and both fighters are eager to put on a show for the fans.</p>
<p>Other fighters scheduled to appear at the event include Amir Khan, George Groves, and Jamie McDonnell. Each of these fighters brings with him a rabid fan base that is expected to turn out in droves for the event. Tickets are already selling quickly, and organizers are expecting a full house for all three days of the event.</p>
